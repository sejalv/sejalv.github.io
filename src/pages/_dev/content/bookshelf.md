## About My Reading

This section brings together my work in tech and creative side. You'll find my thoughts on data leadership and platform strategy, alongside pieces on intersectional feminism, satire, and life in Berlin. More updates coming soon.

## Reading Philosophy

I gravitate toward books that challenge conventional thinking and provide frameworks for understanding complex systems - whether that's human psychology, organizational dynamics, or societal structures.

## Current Reading

- Working through more books on platform engineering and data mesh architectures
- Exploring German literature to improve my language skills
- Always interested in recommendations!
